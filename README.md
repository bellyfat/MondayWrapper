# MondayWrapper
I've been recently working on uploading and updating items to monday.com via their API and their library. I created a reusable wrapper class around methods in their library to simplify perform operations on the site and reduce the repetitive calls to the API. To use this class, you need to have the moncli library for Monday.com installed first. Available here: https://github.com/trix-solutions/moncli
